**Call for proposals is closed as of Oct 26, and we are no longer accepting any talk proposals.**

We received a total of 72 proposals from which to build the program at GCRC14: [http://gardencityruby2014.busyconf.com/schedule/full](http://gardencityruby2014.busyconf.com/schedule/full)

The team is working on the selection process, and will have the full program published by Nov 8th.

For potential speakers: Here are some useful links to inspire you to get started and make a positive impact with the talk:

* [How to write a conference proposal - Mike Moore](http://blowmage.com/2013/01/24/writing-conf-proposals)
* [How not to fail when presenting at an international developer conference - Alan Skorkin](http://webuild.envato.com/blog/how-not-to-fail-when-presenting-at-an-international-developer-conference/)
* [How to talk to Developers - Ben Orenstein](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9JXH7JPjR4)
* [Presentation Skills Considered Harmful - Kathy Sierra](http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/10/4/presentation-skills-considered-harmful)


Talks will be 30 minutes with no extra time for questions. Remember that nearly all our attendees use Ruby daily, so talks should be targeted to an audience of beginner, intermediate or advanced Rubyists. Non-Ruby topics are acceptable if they are somehow related to Ruby, or just seriously awesome.

If your talk is selected you will receive a free pass to attend the conference and get some special speaker swag too. There is no associated travel budget for speakers.
