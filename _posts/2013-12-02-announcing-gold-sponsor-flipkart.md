Thanks to <a href="//www.flipkart.com/" target="_blank">Flipkart</a> for being a Gold Sponsor at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gcrc14" target="_blank">#GCRC14</a> and enabling us to put up an awesome event. Flipkart has always been a big promoter of the Indian Ruby Community.

If you want to understand how to scale Ruby, there is no one better to talk to than the Flipkart Tech Team. They have done a fabulous job of scaling Ruby to an extent that it powers the <a href="//www.flipkart.com/" target="_blank">India's largest e-commerce platform</a>. Reach out to them at the Flipkart sponsor booth at the conference.
