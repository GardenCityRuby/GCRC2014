sponsor_quote: Bang The Table was founded in 2007 to give the silent majority a chance to participate in the democratic processes occurring around them everyday. Our SaaS product helps governments collaborate with their communities.  We dominate Australia and make waves elsewhere because our B2B software feels B2C â€“ intuitive and so so pretty. Come help us build a world-class product.
