We hit with the first surprise when Ben Orenstein mentioned that he had to cancel his trip to India for GCRC14 because some personal emergencies at his end. We thought of having a Live Video Keynote but then realised they are never as effective as live ones. The interaction with the speaker is very critical for conferences such as GCRC which target small number of audience.

The second surprise came when Emily Stolfo also had to cancel her trip as she also has some personal emergencies. 

We are hoping both Ben and Emily can make it for GCRC15.

We've added Hari Krishnan's and Aman King's talks as replacement. Chad Fowler will do the Opening Keynote and Closing Keynote will be done by Ajey Gore.
