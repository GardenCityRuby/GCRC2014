Ruby has a very large and vibrant community around the world. The ever growing ruby community is one of its most important strengths. Being visible and active in the community is very essential for every rubyist.

To enable rubyists to support the community in their individual capacity, #GCRC14 has introduced a special priced ticket called 'Community Supporter Ticket'. The money received through these tickets will be used towards the conference organization and special events around the conference.

The buyers of community supporter tickets are mentioned specially on the gardencityruby website and given a twitter shout.

This is ideal for freelancers, small startup founders who are willing to get exposure in the Indian ruby community.

Grab your 'Community Supporter Ticket' now at <a href="http://gcrc2014.doattend.com/" target="_blank">http://gcrc2014.doattend.com/</a>
