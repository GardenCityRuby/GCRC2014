GCRC14 is going to see a huge number of foreign attendees.
Here are few pointers to help the participants in their visa application process.

### For Attendees from US
Please note there are few recent changes in the visa application process. The vendor handling the Indian visa applications has changed from <a href="https://indiavisa.travisaoutsourcing.com/homepage" target="_blank">Travisa Outsourcing</a> to <a href="http://www.visa.blsindia-usa.com/index.php" target="_blank">BLS International</a>, effective from July 1, 2013.
<br/>Check out your nearest processing center <a href="http://www.visa.blsindia-usa.com/index.php" target="_blank">here</a>.

You could choose a business visa or a tourist visa depending on your plans around the conference. Check out the details of each here.

<br/><a href="http://www.visa.blsindia-usa.com/touristVisa.php" target="_blank">Tourist Visa</a>

We will be sending invitation letters to each speaker/participant, which you'll have to attach as part of the visa application documentation.

Typically the visa application would take 4 to 6 weeks for processing. So, we recommend all the participants to start the process as early as possible.

Important thing to note is the visa validity starts from the day it is issued, so ensure that you apply for the maximum validity possible and make sure that the conference dates are comfortably falling within the validity period.
