Garden City RubyConf is announcing 10 Opportunity Scholarships for anyone who wants to be there, but need financial assistance.  We encourage students, women and other under-represented groups to apply for the scholarships.

Tech conferences are a great opportunity to learn more about Software Development, craftsmanship, building contacts, extending professional and persoanl networks and setting one up for a bright career.  At GCRC, the selected scholars would be paired with experienced programmers, called as mentors, during the conference days.  Many conferences, like [Rocky Mountain Ruby](http://rockymtnruby.com/2012/scholarship) and [RubyConf India](http://lanyrd.com/2013/rubyconfindia/calls/qqbk/) have successfully implemented this in the past.  If you or someone you know are interested in applying, please read the instructions below.
