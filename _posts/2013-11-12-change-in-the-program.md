We hit with a surprise when we heard from [Najaf Ali](https://twitter.com/alinajaf) that it would take atleast four months to complete his visa processing. That definitely does not align with conference timeline. 

The learning that we've from this is that, we should have enquired about the visa processing much earlier to avoid this schedule change.

Anyways, we've chosen the next top talk that we had in our list and updated the program. I will be writing another post explaining the review process in detail.
