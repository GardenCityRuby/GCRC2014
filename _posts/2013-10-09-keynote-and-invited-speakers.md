####Here is some background on how we went about choosing the keynote & invited speakers at #GCRC14:

The first four speakers (the Keynote Speakers at the conference) - [Chad Fowler](https://twitter.com/chadfowler), [Prateek Dayal](https://twitter.com/prateekdayal), [Keavy McMinn](https://twitter.com/keavy), and [Ben Orenstein](https://twitter.com/r00k) - were chosen at [the very start of the #GCRC14 journey back in June/July](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bangalorerug/usTHpRTFqhQ/In_srder1nYJ). [Coby Randquist](https://twitter.com/kobier) and [Ajey Gore](https://twitter.com/ajeygore) were added as speakers later on.

[Chad Fowler](https://twitter.com/chadfowler) - being very popular in the ruby community in India and around the world - was my first choice for a Keynote speaker at the conference. The dates of the conference were set after checking his availabilty.

Ruby conferences in India haven't had a Keynote speaker of Indian origin so far; chose [Prateek Dayal](https://twitter.com/prateekdayal) to set a precedent here. Prateek is a long-time ruby developer based in Bangalore, and is remarkably successful in [building](https://supportbee.com) [product businesses](http://www.muziboo.com); he should be able to bring in an unique Indian flavor to a keynote at a Ruby Conference. 

Ruby conferences in India haven't had a woman keynote speaker as well so far; chose [Keavy McMinn](https://twitter.com/keavy) in this context.

I had watched Keavy's talk **Must Try Harder** at [Mountain.rb Conference](http://rockymtnruby.com/2010) in 2010, and was amazed at the connection she could establish with everyone in the audience by being very vulnerable during the talk. Do check out a version of the talk here:

The fourth keynote speaker - [Ben Orenstein](https://twitter.com/r00k) - was picked based on a team member's suggestion, and was a very easy choice to make because of his RailsConf 2013 talk - **How to Talk with Developers** - which can be watched here:

Thanks to [ThoughtBot](http://thoughtbot.com) for covering the travel expenses for Ben Orenstein, and allowing us a wider latitude to play with our travel expenses budget for speakers. 

[Coby Randquist](https://twitter.com/kobier) - CEO of [Confreaks.com](http://www.confreaks.com) and organizer of [LA RubyConf](http://larubyconf.com) and [Ruby on Ales](http://onales.com) - reached out to us as he had wanted to visit India for long; we grabbed the opportunity with both hands to get him to come over, and help us with the video recording of the talks as well as live-streaming of the talks at #GCRC14. In addition, he will be sharing from his experiences of running Confreaks.com and organizing a couple of regional ruby conferences.

Garden City Ruby Conference is breaking a lot of fresh ground in being the first single-track & regional/city conference in India, and is expected to inspire and nurture more regional/city conferences in other cities in India, starting with Pune later this year, and possibly Mumbai, Delhi, Kochi, Chennai, Mysore, Jaipur, and more. [Ajey Gore](https://twitter.com/ajeygore) was added as the final invited speaker to set the tone for the conversation around regional/city conferences and to take it forward. Ajey has been at the fore-front of Ruby Conference organization work in India through Innovation & Technology Trust which has been putting up the hugely successful annual [RubyConf India events](http://rubyconfindia.org/2013/) since 2010.

Thanks to the keynote & invited speakers who made it possible for us to plan an awesome conference around their presence.

Our [Call for proposals](http://www.gardencityruby.org/cfp/) is now open; do take this opportunity to submit a talk proposal, and possibly share the stage with our distinguished keynote/invited speakers at GCRC14!
