Here are some quick & handy tips for speakers.

###Presentation & Demos

- Make sure the laptops you use are loaded with your presentation/demos, and also carry copies on the cloud or on removable media.
- It's also recommended to have the console outputs ready, in case your demos don't work as expected.
- The organizing team will have a Macbook ready, which you can copy the presentation to. If your laptop dies, your talk doesn't have to! :)

###Humor

- Humor can provide a powerful boost to the audience's attention span.
- Please follow the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/)
- Be tasteful. If you have a joke that could offend some sections of the community, it's probably not right for a conference. Clean humor is best appreciated.
- Start off with a joke or end with one or both. Make the presentation memorable.
- Don't overdo it, lest it be mistaken as stand-up comedy!

###Engagement

- Provide examples which the audience can relate to. If they feel "Oh yeah, I've been there!", they'll be more receptive to your talk.
- Don't RTFM, but rather share your experiences, pitfalls and gotchas. The audience is there for stories, not a boring reading of a technical document.
